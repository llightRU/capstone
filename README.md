In this thesis, we address the problem of processing large datasets of customer information collected by banks through marketing campaigns for savings services and develop a tool that applies predictive and classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic Regression. This tool aims to analyse and predict potential customers within the available dataset. The main challenge lies in using a dataset of user responses to marketing campaigns to capture the percentage likelihood that they will use the companyâ€™s services. Through our analysis, we have identified specific challenges including input data, model calibration, and achieving results that closely mirror reality.

Regarding the difficulty with input data analysis, we face issues related to the authenticity of bank datasets due to their confidential nature. Therefore, the data used in this project is a synthesised and public dataset from UIC University [1] . However, with the high realism in our testing phases, we believe that actual datasets incorporated into the tool in the future could also yield reliable results. The next major technical challenge is model calibration. We have implemented testing and applied various tuning methods to optimise the performance of the machine learning models discussed. As the problem involves statistical data, the authenticity of the results requires particular attention.
